# Detecting-Edges-and-Finding-Patterns

Detecting Edges and finding Patterns in diverse images using different methods and algorithms.

The code Algorithms include:
1. Sobel Edge Detection
2. Gradient Orientation
3. Canny Edge Detection
4. Hough transformations - Lines and Circles

All the above algorithms are developed and handled on a variety of images, and of course presented and compared with respect to the original image.
